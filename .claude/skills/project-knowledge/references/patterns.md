## Project-Specific Code Patterns

**Module boundary:** both `:core-runtime` AND `:core-settings` must have zero Compose / Activity / ViewModel imports. If a core class needs a Context, accept it as a constructor parameter — do not reach for `android.app.Application`. Check during code review: `grep -rEn "androidx.compose|androidx.activity" core-runtime/src/main core-settings/src/main` — zero hits expected (TAC-7, TAC-8 in Phase 2 tech-spec).

**Library-module manifest hygiene:** `:core-runtime/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` must declare every runtime surface that library code touches — `<uses-permission>` for every permission-annotated API call made from library code (e.g., `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` for `NotificationManagerCompat.notify`), and a `<service tools:node="merge">` override for every system-provided service the library relies on (e.g., `androidx.work.impl.foreground.SystemForegroundService` with `foregroundServiceType="dataSync"`). Rationale: Android lint is scoped per module. `:app`'s final merged manifest is invisible to library-lint. Empty library manifest → false-positive `MissingPermission` / `SpecifyForegroundServiceType` errors even though the merged APK is runtime-correct. `tools:node="merge"` makes manifest-merger silently reconcile the duplicate with `:app`'s declaration, so there is no conflict at build time. Companion rule: any WorkManager-class-name reference inside `:app`'s own manifest (e.g., the `<service>` declaration for `SystemForegroundService`) requires `androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx` to be exposed as `api` (not `implementation`) from `:core-runtime`, otherwise `:app:lintDebug` fires `MissingClass`.

**Cross-module FQN plumbing via companion fields:** classes that live in `:core-runtime` but need to reference `:app`-only types (e.g., `MainActivity` for `PendingIntent`) must never hardcode the FQN. `:app` sets the string on a companion field during `SanctumApplication.onCreate` (see `DefaultDownloadRepository.mainActivityFqn`). Consumers inside `:core-runtime` (e.g., `DownloadWorker`) must `require(fqn.startsWith("app.sanctum.machina."))` before `Class.forName` — this is a package-prefix guard, not a complete whitelist, and it exists specifically to prevent arbitrary-class-load escalation if an attacker ever controls the intent extras (see TAC-14 in Phase 1 spec).

**ErrorLog component strings are a closed whitelist, enforced at runtime.** Only these 14 values are allowed as the `component` argument to `ErrorLog.e(component, description, cause?)`: `"download"`, `"inference-init"`, `"inference"`, `"inference-cleanup"`, `"settings-io"`, `"camera"`, `"audio"`, `"attachment-decode"`, `"model"`, `"engine-warmup"`, `"history-read"`, `"history-write"`, `"attachment-save"`, `"attachment-read"`. Unknown component → `IllegalArgumentException` thrown at call site (covered by `ErrorLogTest`). Adding a new component requires updating the constant set in `ErrorLog.kt` AND this doc AND the reviewing spec. Rationale: grep-friendly, bounded taxonomy, mapped one-to-one to specific failure modes.

Phase-origin breakdown of the whitelist: the first 4 (`download`, `inference-init`, `inference`, `inference-cleanup`) shipped in Phase 1. `settings-io`, `camera`, `audio`, `attachment-decode` were added in Phase 2 (multimodal input + per-model settings DataStore — see Decision D27). The remaining 6 (`model`, `engine-warmup`, `history-read`, `history-write`, `attachment-save`, `attachment-read`) are Phase 3 additions: `model` covers registry-level init failures beyond inference-init, `engine-warmup` covers `WarmupCoordinator` lifecycle failures, the `history-*` pair covers Room chat/message read/write failures (and the `di/AppModule.provideSanctumDatabase` corruption-recovery path), and the `attachment-save`/`-read` pair covers the Phase 3 disk staging and decode-on-read paths for images and audio.

**`crash.log` is a separate channel — never goes through `ErrorLog`.** `CrashHandler` writes `filesDir/logs/crash.log` directly via `File.writeText` (head-truncated to 100 KB, overwrite semantics). `ErrorLog.ALLOWED_COMPONENTS` is never extended with a `"crash"` entry. Rationale: `ErrorLog.e` is `suspend` and requires a live coroutine dispatcher — unsafe in an uncaught exception handler where the JVM is about to die. The one-line `ERROR [component] description :: cause` format also cannot hold a multi-line stacktrace. Any future code touching crash-log assembly belongs in `app/.../crash/` or `app/.../logexport/`, not in `:core-runtime`. See `architecture.md § On-disk log layout`.

**Crash reporting and cross-process state (Phase 2.5+).** `CrashHandler` is installed in `SanctumApplication.onCreate` behind an `if (getProcessName() == packageName)` guard — `Application.onCreate` executes in every OS process that mounts the `<application>` tag, including the `:crash` recovery process. Without the guard, a second handler in `:crash` could recurse on a crash inside `CrashReportActivity`. The guard uses `Application.getProcessName()` (API 28+, always available at minSdk 31). Banner visibility (`CrashState`) is backed exclusively by filesystem presence of `crash.log` + `crash.log.dismissed` — not DataStore or SharedPreferences. Rationale: the `:crash` process and the main process only share disk reliably; DataStore requires coroutines and can't be written safely from a dying process.

**Non-Hilt construction in the `:crash` recovery process.** `CrashReportActivity` is a plain `ComponentActivity` (no `@AndroidEntryPoint`). It instantiates `LogExportManager` via a secondary `LogExportManager(context)` constructor that builds its own collaborators from a `Context`. Rationale: the `:crash` process has a fresh, empty Hilt graph; a binding failure in Hilt's generated code during crash recovery would produce a second crash on top of the original one. Any class that must run in `:crash` should avoid the main-process Hilt graph entirely.

**SAF log export.** User-facing log export uses `ActivityResultContracts.CreateDocument("text/plain")` with a suggested filename (`sanctum-log-YYYYMMDD-HHmm.txt`, formatted with `Locale.ROOT`). This avoids `FileProvider` registration, URI-permission granting, and a third-party app in the share chain. The caller writes assembled content via `ContentResolver.openOutputStream(uri)`. An in-flight guard flag (`var launching`) prevents launching a second SAF dialog before the first one returns its result — reset in a `finally` block on all three branches (success / IOException / cancel).

**ErrorLog length bounding** (Phase 2 addition per TAC-15): `description` truncated at 500 chars, `cause.message` truncated at 200 chars, control whitespace collapsed. Prevents dumping full stacktraces with SELinux context / hardware identifiers into the on-device log.

**Model lifecycle:** LiteRT-LM inference engines are expensive to create (5–30 sec) and hold native state. Engine ownership is Phase 3's most important structural rule:

- **Ownership lives at the `:app` layer, not in the VM.** `WarmupCoordinator` (`@Singleton`, injected with `DefaultModelRegistry` + `AppSettingsRepository` + `ErrorLog`) holds the engine lifecycle. `SanctumApplication.onCreate` triggers `WarmupCoordinator.warmupDefault()` on a background scope so the Home screen renders while the engine warms.
- **`ChatViewModel.onCleared()` does NOT call `registry.cleanup()`.** That call was deleted entirely in Phase 3 (Decision 5 / AC-E6). The engine outlives any single `NavBackStackEntry` — backing out of a chat and re-entering it reuses the warm engine. Navigation between two persistent chats that share the same `chat.model_id` is free; only the Room history is re-read.
- **Cleanup happens in exactly two situations:** (1) cross-model switch — `warmupCoordinator.cancelAndRestart(newModelId)` serialises via `restartMutex`, cancels the in-flight warmup Job if any, then has `DefaultModelRegistry.initialize(newName)` release any prior `Ready` / `Initializing` entry for a non-target model before flipping the target to `Initializing`. A `catch(CancellationException)` inside `initialize` resets the target to `Idle` so a cancelled warmup cannot strand a stale `Initializing` status (Task 18 B2). (2) process death — the OS reclaims native memory; no explicit shutdown hook.
- **`resetConversation` is the cheap same-model reset.** Triggered by the ↻ button or a semi-light setting change (system prompt / thinking toggle): `registry.resetConversation(modelName, systemPrompt = effective)` keeps the native engine allocated, clears KV cache, and re-renders the Jinja template with the new effective system prompt. Milliseconds, no reinit dialog.
- **Heavy-setting reinit bypasses `WarmupCoordinator`.** When the user flips the accelerator, `ChatViewModel.applyHeavySetting` calls `registry.cleanup + registry.initialize` directly (under the same `lifecycleMutex`), with a modal `ReinitProgressDialog` owning the blocking UX. This is intentional — the coordinator's cancel-and-restart semantics would race with the modal.
- **`Model.instance: Any?` remains in the data class** (inherited from Gallery — see the "Model.instance anti-pattern" entry below). The Phase-3 discipline is that only `DefaultModelRegistry.initialize` / `releaseEngine` may read or write this field; every other call site reads engine state through `ModelEntry.initStatus` (a `sealed class` with `Idle` / `Initializing` / `Ready` / `Failed`).

**Streaming assistant messages:** Phase 2 is in-memory-only — messages live in `ChatViewModel._messages: StateFlow<List<Message>>` and are discarded on process death (D1 Phase 2 user-spec). The thinking channel accumulates separately into `thinkingSb: StringBuilder`, gated once per send on `model.llmSupportThinking && effectiveConfig[ENABLE_THINKING]`; mid-stream config flip cannot half-populate the bubble. Attachments (`Bitmap` / raw PCM `ByteArray`) are snapshotted into `Message.attachments` when the USER message is appended and cleared from `_attachments` immediately after — so the history bubble reflects exactly what was dispatched (AC-26). Phase 3 will route the completed message into Room on `done = true`; the in-memory flow pattern from above will carry over.

**Error logging conventions:**
- **ERROR level only.** No `Log.i`, `Log.w`, `Log.d` in production code paths. Every `Log.e` is a real incident worth writing to the on-device log file.
- **One log = one event.** No multi-line logs, no emoji, no ornamental dividers. Format: `ERROR [component] short description :: cause`.
- **Components that must log errors** (mapped one-to-one to specific failure modes): model initialize failed, inference failed, model download failed, HuggingFace auth failed, Room migration failed, history load failed, history write failed, attachment write failed, attachment read failed.
- **Log file location:** `context.filesDir/logs/errors.log`. Rotate when size exceeds 2 MB: rename to `errors.log.1` (overwriting any previous rotated copy) and start fresh. Never uploaded anywhere.

**`Model.instance: Any?` is an anti-pattern — do not port it.** Gallery stores runtime state inside the data model. In `:core-runtime` the separation is: `ModelDefinition` (immutable config — id, paths, backend choices) vs `ModelRuntimeHandle` (mutable runtime state — engine, conversation). The registry maps definition → optional handle.

**Room DAOs are interfaces with suspend/Flow functions only.** No blocking DAO methods. ViewModels collect `Flow<List<T>>` and expose `StateFlow` to Compose. (Phase 3 — Room is not yet integrated as of `v0.2-ui`.)

**Markdown rendering goes through `SafeMarkdown`, never `RichText` / `Markdown` directly.** `SafeMarkdown` installs a scheme-whitelisted `LocalUriHandler` (`SafeUriHandler`) that allows only `http` / `https` (case-insensitive); all other schemes — `intent:`, `sms:`, `tel:`, `javascript:`, `file:`, `content:`, `data:`, `market:`, malformed — are silently ignored (blocked-scheme clicks are expected UX, not errors; no `ErrorLog` entry). LLM output is rendered through this wrapper so a `[text](intent://...)` in the assistant's markdown cannot launch arbitrary intents. Applies everywhere markdown lands: `MessageBubble`, `ThinkingBlock`, `AboutScreen`.

**Privacy hardening at the manifest level.** `:app/AndroidManifest.xml` must keep `android:allowBackup="false"` AND `android:dataExtractionRules="@xml/data_extraction_rules"`. The XML file excludes `<cloud-backup>` + `<device-transfer>` at `domain="root" path="."`. Both together block Google auto-backup AND device-to-device transfer channels. `FLAG_SECURE` is explicitly NOT added — user must be able to screenshot their own chats. Rationale: no cloud sync is a manifesto constraint (see `project.md § Out of Scope`); default Android backup silently ships DataStore and (Phase 3+) Room history to Google Drive. Closing this in Phase 2 is cheaper than after Room exists.

**Three-tier settings application classification (D15).** When applying inference-setting changes to a live engine, the field determines the path:
- **Light** (`temperature`, `topK`, `topP`, `maxTokens`) — override stored in DataStore, new `model.configValues` assigned; applies from next `send()` without engine touch. Active stream is not interrupted.
- **Semi-light** (`systemPromptDefault`, `enableThinking`) — override stored, then `registry.resetConversation(modelName, systemPrompt = effective)` is called: engine stays initialised but KV-cache clears and Jinja template re-renders with the new values. Chat UI history is also cleared (consistency with engine state). Snackbar "Настройки применены, контекст чата сброшен".
- **Heavy** (`accelerator`) — modal `HeavyChangeDialog` → confirm → `ReinitProgressDialog` → `cleanup + initialize` (5–30 sec). UI message list survives; engine context resets.

`ChatViewModel.classifyApplyLevel(overrides)` is the single entry point; any new inference field must be added to this classifier with explicit justification for its tier. `enableThinking` was reclassified from heavy to semi-light after Honor 200 smoke in Task 11 — `litertlm 0.10.0` accepts the flag change through `resetConversation` alone.



**Hilt module organization:** one module per concern (`InferenceModule`, `PersistenceModule`, `DownloadModule`, `AuthModule`). Avoid a single "god module". `:core-runtime` exposes services via interfaces so `:app` can swap or stub them in tests.

## Git Workflow

### Branch Structure

- **`master`** (tag, not branch) — immutable marker on the initial commit. `git checkout master` returns the project to its zero state. Used only as a nuclear "restart everything from scratch" escape hatch.
- **`main`** — the linear history of approved phases. Only merged into after the user explicitly says "утверждаю". Never force-pushed.
- **`phase/N-name`** — working branches for each phase: `phase/1-foundation`, `phase/2-ui`, `phase/3-history`, `phase/4-projects`, `phase/5-release`. Created from `main`. All work for a phase happens here. Merged to `main` via `--no-ff` (preserving the phase boundary) once approved. After merge, tagged (`v0.1-foundation`, etc.) and the branch may be deleted.
- **`phase/N-name.experiment-*`** — optional sub-branches inside a phase branch, for risky refactors where failure should not touch the phase branch. Example: `phase/1-foundation.split-model-manager` while dismantling Gallery's `ModelManagerViewModel` god-object. Merged back to the parent phase branch when the experiment lands.

### Commit Style

Conventional Commits: `feat: …`, `fix: …`, `refactor: …`, `chore: …`, `docs: …`, `test: …`. One concern per commit. Commit messages in English.

Commit frequency follows the methodology's commit strategy — one commit per stable step (draft → validation round → approval for specs; implementation → review-fix rounds → decisions for tasks), not per keystroke.

### Tags

- `master` — initial commit (immutable start point).
- `v0.1-foundation` — end of Phase 1.
- `v0.2-ui` — end of Phase 2.
- `v0.3-history` — end of Phase 3.
- `v0.4-projects` — end of Phase 4.
- `v1.0-release` — end of Phase 5 (first public release).

### Security & Quality Gates

- **Pre-commit:** `gitleaks` scans staged changes for secrets (HuggingFace tokens, API keys, keystore passwords). Commit blocked if anything matches. The repo should never contain a secret even once, since it will become public after Phase 5 testing and git history is permanent.
- **Pre-push:** run `:core-runtime` unit tests. Push blocked on failure. Keeps `main` always green for the core.

### `.gitignore` essentials (enforced from the start)

`.idea/`, `*.iml`, `build/`, `local.properties`, `.env`, `*.keystore`, `*.jks`, `gradle.properties.local`, `release-keys/`, `app/schemas/*.local.json`, log output files.

## Testing & Verification

### Test Infrastructure

- **Unit tests (`:core-runtime/src/test/` and `:app/src/test/`)**: JUnit 4.13.2 + Robolectric 4.12. Hand-rolled fakes; no Mockito or MockK (pattern established by `ErrorLogTest` and carried into Phase 2.5 tests). Run via `./gradlew :core-runtime:test` / `./gradlew :app:test`. Target for `:core-runtime`: `LlmModelHelper` wrapper logic, `ModelRegistry`, `DownloadRepository` edge cases, allowlist parser, config validation, log formatter. Target for `:app`: `crash/` and `logexport/` unit behaviour (CrashHandler, CrashState, LogExportManager, DeviceInfoCollector, LogcatReader, TapCounter, SanctumApplication guard branches).
- **Instrumentation DAO tests (`:app/src/androidTest/`)**: androidx.test + `androidx.room:room-testing`. Run via `./gradlew :app:connectedAndroidTest` on a connected device or emulator. Target: every Room DAO + every schema migration.
- **Manual smoke test with real LiteRT-LM**: run before every phase release. Checklist in the per-phase tech-spec. Minimum: load a downloaded Gemma-4-E2B-it, send "Hello", receive a non-empty response, receive streamed tokens, reset conversation, receive a second response.

**What we explicitly do not test:** Compose UI (no `ComposeTestRule`-based UI tests), visual appearance (checked manually in Phase 2 and Phase 5), end-to-end inference in CI (no model in CI; see manual smoke test above).

### Agent Verification Methods

- **Gradle build / unit tests:** `./gradlew :core-runtime:test` and `./gradlew build` can be executed by the agent. Treat `BUILD FAILED` as hard stop. Treat test failures likewise.
- **Static checks:** `./gradlew lintDebug` catches Android-specific issues; `./gradlew detekt` (if configured) catches Kotlin style.
- **Schema diff check:** when touching Room entities, compare generated `app/schemas/{db}/{version}.json` against previous — any diff without a migration means a broken change.

### User Verification Methods

- **Runtime behavior on device:** only the user can install the APK on the Honor 200 and verify UI responsiveness, model loading speed, multimodal input, visual polish. Agents can describe what to look for; they cannot see the screen.
- **Comparative speed vs Gallery:** "на той же модели скорость не хуже" — verified by the user running the same prompt on Gallery and Sanctum Machina back-to-back. This is the hard success criterion for Phase 1.

## Business Rules

### Chat context window

Each chat is constrained by the active model's context window (e.g., 32K tokens for Gemma-4-E2B/E4B). Once the running token count of all messages in the chat exceeds the window, the tail of older messages is dropped from the prompt sent to the model — but NOT from Room storage. The user sees the full chat history; only the model sees a truncated tail.

Policy decision deferred to Phase 3: exact truncation strategy (hard cut at oldest-first, summarize-then-drop, or "start a new chat" prompt to the user). Default for Phase 3 MVP: hard cut, oldest-first.

### Project system prompt inheritance

When the user opens a new chat inside a project, the chat's system prompt is inherited from the project. The user may override it for a single chat — that override is stored on the chat row, not the project row. Changing the project's system prompt does not retroactively change existing chats' effective system prompt (they keep whatever they started with), but affects new chats in the project.

### Model switching mid-chat

A committed chat's `model_id` is immutable — set at `commitDraftChat` time from whatever model was active when the first message was sent, and never updated afterwards. Reopening a historical chat re-warms that exact model.

**Draft mode (pre-commit chat).** TopAppBar shows a `DropdownMenu` model picker listing every `SUCCEEDED` entry from the registry. Selecting the currently-warm model is a silent no-op. Selecting a different model opens a cross-model `AlertDialog` ("Переключение займёт 20–30 секунд, продолжить?"); on confirm → `ChatViewModel.loadModel(modelId)` pins `_chatModelId` to the new target (so the VM tracks it) and then calls `warmupCoordinator.cancelAndRestart(modelId)`. The TopAppBar chip switches to «Загружаю {name}…» while the coordinator releases the prior engine (single-engine invariant) and initialises the new one; the chat body stays on the draft input (no full-screen Loading overlay). Once the new engine is Ready the chip flips back to the model name and Send re-enables.

**Persistent chat with a non-active model.** `ChatScreen` TopAppBar renders a «Загрузить» button whenever the entry for `chat.model_id` is `Idle` or `Failed` (the chat was opened while another engine is warm, or the prior engine failed init). Tap → `warmupCoordinator.cancelAndRestart(chat.model_id)`. Same release/warm sequence and TopAppBar chip as above.

**Persistent chat with same model as the warm engine.** Room-backed history loads instantly via `messageDao.observeByChat(chatId)`; Send is enabled immediately because the engine is already `Ready`. If the last persisted row is an unpaired USER (Draft→Persistent handover that committed before the first assistant reply ran, or a process-kill during streaming — AC-R3), `ChatViewModel` auto-resumes inference once on the first Ready signal. The USER row is NOT re-persisted; attachments on the row are re-decoded from disk via the B1 helpers and forwarded to `runInference` (Task 18 B4 + post-smoke round).

**Heavy setting (accelerator flip) inside a chat** is not a "model switch" in the `model_id` sense — the same model restarts on a new backend. Handled by `ChatViewModel.applyHeavySetting` with a modal `ReinitProgressDialog`; see the Model lifecycle entry above.

### Quick chat lifecycle (incognito)

A quick chat is ephemeral. It lives in a `QuickChatSession` object attached to the chat coordinator and is **never** written to Room. Termination conditions (any one of these):
- User navigates away from the quick-chat screen (back press, switching to a project, opening settings).
- App process is killed (either by the system or by the user).

On termination: session object is dropped, and any attachments the user added during the chat (photos, audio) are deleted from `filesDir/quick/` immediately. No history remains.

**UX implications:** no title autogeneration (there is nothing to title), no "Continue last chat" entry for quick chats. Leaving the screen shows a confirmation dialog only if a streaming response is in progress — otherwise silent exit.

**Code rule:** `QuickChatSession` must never take a `chat_id` from Room; it must never be passed to any `MessageDao` or `ChatDao`. Reviewers (manual and automated) check for this.

### Per-model inference settings override

Defaults come from the allowlist (`models_meta.default_config_json`). User overrides live in `models_meta.user_overrides_json` as a JSON object containing only the fields the user changed; effective config is `default ∪ overrides`. "Reset to defaults" sets `user_overrides_json` to null. Overrides do not travel with chats — changing overrides affects all future inferences with that model, including reopened old chats.
